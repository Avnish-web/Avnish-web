I'm a DevOps Engineer passionate about automating infrastructure, streamlining CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring reliable software delivery. 
With hands-on experience in tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Terraform, I enjoy building scalable, cloud-native environments.

Currently working on deploying applications using CI/CD pipelines on AWS.

Always learning, always automating.
